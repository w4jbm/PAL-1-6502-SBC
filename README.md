# PAL-1-6502-SBC

This area contains code and material related to the PAL-1, a 6502-based SBC similar to the KIM.

Feel free to correct me, but in general the KIM, introduced in 1976, seems to have been the first commercially produced, fully-assembled, ready-to-run, affordable, microprocesor-based personal computer. (There are a lot of adjectives in that...) It was originally produced by MOS Technologies (later acquied by Commodore) and sold for $245. That all seems like a pretty significant turning point to me--no soldering iron required, no boot-strapping from a front-panel, no terminal or teletype required (but they were supported if you had them), and one of the better early manuals that shows this was really meant to be a "trainer" and demo system for the MOS 6502.

There are a number of 'clones' available ranging from ones that support the old expansion bus to simple ones based on Arduino emulators that cost under $20. The PAL-1 is availabe on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/tkoak/pal-1-a-mos-6502-powered-computer-kit/) although it is currently sold out.
