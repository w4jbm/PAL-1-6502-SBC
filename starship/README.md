# Starship Animated Demo

This is an animated demo of the RIOT. There is nothing elegant and the use of macros and editor tricks let me build it quickly, but also means it is bloated in size.

There are two important things this shows from my perspective. All REAL hobbyist computers need to be able to show the image of a starship, preferably in a way that is automated. Also, everything ties back to my first computer, an Ohio Scientific C1P, in some way. In this case, the 8x8 character graphics on the C1P were used as the source for the starship bitmap.

You can also look at it run on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UThleUTNTBM).

I have recently started using the JUST utility and it is easier to do the things I want instead of using MAKE. (The steps to build this are in the source as well as pretty evident from the justfile.)
