# Building a Kim

"...just give me at least some credit like 'Stolen from Ruud'"

This is some information related to work by Ruud Baltissen in the Netherlands. This seems to be some of the first serious look at bulding a clone of the KIM-1 that used the more widely available 6532.

I actually have learned a lot about the 6530 as I've studied the PAL-1 and Ruud's work. It turns out that the 6530 was not just "a chip" you bought off the shelf. It was, instead, a chip that was typically customized with ROM code and a customer address scheme. That means that 6530s are not interchangable--if you are replacing a specific chip in a specific device, you need the version of the 6530 built for that application.

The 6532 was more generalized, included no ROM, had twice the RAM, and left decoding to glue logic instead of being part of the chip's design.

I had seen the text documents floating around or on various web sites, but only recently came across [Ruud's website](http://www.baltissen.org/newhtm/index4.htm).

I've put copies of this here because I still find myself referring to it from time to time.
